# Update Operation in Django Shell

## Purpose
This document describes the process for updating an existing `Book` instance in the Django shell. In this example, we will change the title of the book titled **"1984"** to **"Nineteen Eighty-Four"** and save the changes.

```
from library.models import Book

# Retrieve the book by title
book = Book.objects.get(title="1984")

# Update the title
book.title = "Nineteen Eighty-Four"
book.save()  # Save the changes to the database

# Expected output: 'Nineteen Eighty-Four', confirming the title has been updated
book.title # Output: 'Nineteen Eighty-Four'
```
